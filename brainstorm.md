# LLM CLI Tool Brainstorm

## Core Concept
A CLI tool that acts as an AI assistant for both System Administration (on Linux/FreeBSD, including root operations via `sudo`) and Software Development (Claude Code-like capabilities). It offers flexibility to switch between different LLM models (Claude, GPT, Gemini) and aims to be publishable as a package for others to easily install and use.

## Architecture

### Core Components
1. **CLI Interface** - Command parsing, user interaction
2. **Model Manager** - Handles model selection and API integration
3. **Context Manager** - Maintains conversation history
4. **Tool Framework** - Integrates system tools for file operations, web access, etc.
5. **Output Formatter** - Renders responses appropriately for terminal

### Model Integration
- Abstract adapter pattern for different LLM APIs
- Standardized prompt formatting across models
- Configuration system for API keys and preferences
- Capability detection for model-specific features
- **Model-specific Tool Implementation** - Hardcode specific tool sets for OpenAI and Gemini initially. Consider specific tools or refined bash tool usage for common sysadmin operations (package management, service control, network config) to improve reliability for these tasks, potentially abstracting OS differences.

## User Experience

### Model Selection
```
# Set default model
$ llm config set-default-model gemini-2.5-pro

# Use specific model for current session
$ llm --model gpt-o1 
```

### Configuration
```
$ llm config add-api-key claude CLAUDE_API_KEY
$ llm config add-api-key openai OPENAI_API_KEY
$ llm config add-api-key google GOOGLE_API_KEY
```

### Session Management
- Persistent conversations with model switching
- Ability to export/import sessions
- Session isolation for different projects
- Context management with `/compact` command:
  - Warns when approaching token limits (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro's 1M context)
  - Generates conversation summary on demand
  - Carries summary forward to new context window
  - Allows for theoretically infinite conversation length

## Technical Considerations

### API Differences
- Handle token limits per model
- Account for different capabilities (code generation, tools, etc.)
- Normalize response formats for consistent UX

### Authentication
- Secure storage of API keys
- Support for organization accounts and custom endpoints

### Performance
- Streaming responses for all models
- Local caching of contexts to minimize token usage
- Efficient file handling for large codebases

## Implementation Plan

1. Start with basic CLI framework (Click, Typer, or similar)
2. Implement Gemini 2.5 Pro integration first:
   - Basic conversation capability
   - Token tracking and context management
   - `/compact` command implementation
3. Add basic file operations and tool integration
4. Expand to OpenAI models 
5. Enhance with advanced tools (search, web access)
6. Package for distribution (PyPI/npm)
7. Create documentation and examples
8. Refine UX based on user feedback

## Distribution Strategy

### Package Publishing
- Publish to package managers (PyPI for Python, npm for Node.js)
- Create easy installation process (`pip install llm-cli` or `npm install -g llm-cli`)
- Version management and release cycle

### First-Run Experience
- Interactive configuration on first run
- API key setup wizard
- Default model selection
- Quick tutorial/example workflow

### System Administration Capabilities - Brainstorm

*   **Core Execution**:
    *   Reliable `bash` command execution, including `sudo -n` for root access.
    *   Parsing and understanding output from common sysadmin commands.
*   **File System & Configuration**:
    *   Editing configuration files (e.g., `/etc/fstab`, `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) with care and confirmation.
    *   Managing permissions, ownership.
*   **Package Management**:
    *   Wrappers or guided LLM usage of `apt`, `yum`, `dnf`, `pkg` etc. for installing, updating, removing packages.
*   **Service Management**:
    *   Wrappers or guided LLM usage of `systemctl`, `service` for checking status, starting, stopping, restarting services.
*   **Monitoring & Logging**:
    *   Tools to view system logs (`journalctl`, specific application logs).
    *   Tools or prompts to get summaries of resource usage (`df`, `free`, `vmstat`, `top/htop` output parsing).
*   **Networking**:
    *   Viewing network configuration (`ip addr`, `ifconfig`).
    *   (Future) Modifying firewall rules (`ufw`, `firewalld`, `iptables`, `pf`).
*   **User Management**:
    *   (Future, with extreme caution) Assisting with user creation, modification, group management.
*   **Scripting & Automation**:
    *   Leverage coding assistance to help write shell scripts or Python scripts for sysadmin tasks.
*   **Troubleshooting**:
    *   Guide the LLM to ask clarifying questions and use diagnostic tools to help users troubleshoot issues.

## Open Questions

- How to handle tool capabilities that differ between models?
- What's the best local storage approach for conversation history?
- How to implement efficient codebase indexing for context?
- Should we support plugins/extensions for custom tools?
- How to ensure safety and prevent destructive operations when using `sudo`, beyond current banned commands and plan approval? Are there 'read-only' modes for sysadmin tasks?
- How to best abstract OS differences (e.g., package managers, service control commands) for the LLM or for tools?
